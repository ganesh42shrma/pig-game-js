# pig-game-js
Developed a pig game using javascript to better understand and implement the fundamentals of DOM manipulation in javascript.
The game works as follows:
There are two players in the game: player 1 and Player 2
Each time the dice is rolled, the number of dice is accumulated to the total score of the player, iff the dice rolled is not 1, if it is 1 then the player loses his current points and the active player switch from player 1 to player 2 (i.e it is 
player 2's turn).
each player can choose to hold their score if they wish to accumulate their score to the total score at any point. If they wish to hold, then the current accumulated score
is added to the player's total score and then the player is switched again
The winner is declared as the player who is first to accumulate 100 total points.
